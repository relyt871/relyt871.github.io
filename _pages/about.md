I'm a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at ACM Honors Class, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuhao Zhang](http://www.zyhwtc.com/). I am now visiting Brown University as a research intern, hosted by [Prof. Yu Cheng](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ycheng79/). 

My current research involves online algorithms, graph algorithms and algorithmic game theory. I also have broad interest in a wide range of algorithmic problems, especially those at the intersection of computer science and economics.

You can find my CV here: [CV](../assets/Tianle_Jiang_CV.pdf).
