I'm a junior undergraduate student from ACM Honors Class, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuhao Zhang](http://www.zyhwtc.com/). Starting July 2024, I will be visiting Brown University as a research intern, hosted by [Prof. Yu Cheng](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ycheng79/). 

I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, especially design and analysis of algorithms. My current research involves Online Algorithms, Algorithmic Game Theory and Graph Algorithms.

You can find my CV here: [CV](../assets/Tianle_Jiang_CV.pdf).
